## Quick Start

1. **Download** `dgs-priority-matrix.html` 
2. **Open** in any browser (works offline)
3. **Add tasks** with impact/effort ratings
4. **Focus** on "Do First" quadrant for maximum ROI

No installation, no signup, no complexity.

## How It Works

The Eisenhower Matrix organizes tasks into four actionable quadrants:

| Quadrant | Impact | Effort | Action | Examples |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| üî¥ **Do First** | High | Low | Quick wins | Client deliverables, urgent fixes |
| üü° **Schedule** | High | High | Plan dedicated time | Major projects, skill development |
| üîµ **Delegate** | Low | Low | Hand off when possible | Admin tasks, routine maintenance |
| ‚ö™ **Eliminate** | Low | High | Avoid or minimize | Scope creep, perfectionist tweaks |

## Perfect For

- **Freelancers** managing multiple client priorities
- **Consultants** balancing project demands  
- **Small business owners** optimizing their time
- **Anyone** drowning in "urgent" requests

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Zero Setup** - Single HTML file, works anywhere
- ‚úÖ **Mobile-First** - Manage priorities on the go
- ‚úÖ **Offline Ready** - No internet required
- ‚úÖ **Client-Focused** - Built by freelancers, for freelancers

## Why This Matrix Works for Freelancers

**Stop Revenue Leakage**: Focus on high-impact, low-effort wins that unlock payments and generate testimonials.

**End Decision Fatigue**: Clear visual framework for triaging client requests and internal tasks.

**Scale Intelligently**: Identify what to delegate so you can focus on $200/hour work, not $20/hour tasks.

## Pro Tips

- **Daily Review**: Spend 5 minutes each morning organizing your matrix
- **Client Updates**: Screenshot your "Do First" quadrant for status reports  
- **Boundary Setting**: Use "Eliminate" quadrant to professionally decline scope creep
- **Time Blocking**: Assign specific hours to each quadrant type
